I am a passionate and results-driven professional currently pursuing a Master's in Engineering from [Your University] in Pune. I completed my Bachelor's in [Your Major] in 2022, and I am actively expanding my skill set through a comprehensive Frontend Development course on Udemy, focusing on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React JS. In addition to my frontend expertise, I am proficient in Core Java and have experience working with databases.
